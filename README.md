Install:

To install you have 2 options:


(YOU NEED GCC INSTALLED FOR STEPS A - B)
A) Download Install and run it.

B) Run this command: rm -rf Zephyr-Lite && git clone https://github.com/Thoq-jar/Zephyr-Lite.git && cd Zephyr-Lite && cd main && g++ main.cpp -o Zephyr `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0` && ./Zephyr

(YOU DO NOT NEED GCC INSTALLED FOR THIS)
C) Go to releases and download the file named 'Zephyr' and run the binary instead of compiling yourself.
